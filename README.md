# Rock Paper Scissors Game
## Purpose:
- Practice OOP designs by creating my own version of Rock Paper Scissors

## User Stories:
- As a user, I should be able to play with a friend
- As a user, I should be able to play with a computer
- As a user, I should know who won
- As a user, I should know the score of the game
- As a user, I should be able to pick rock, paper, or scissors
- As a user, I should be able to play again

## Requirements:
- Create multiple classes
- Validate user input and handle errors
- Create an interface
- Use Scanner to scan user input
- Use public, private, and static variables, methods, and members within each class appropriately.
- Display game history

## Language and Tool:
- Java 11
- IntelliJ

## Project Takeaways:
- A better understanding of Has-a relationship vs Is-a relationship
- How to use abstract class and inheritence
- By using Optional, I can handle the NullPointerException and I can alternate the value to return
- Use hash map to store a key and value
- Using enums to store a possible set of values
- By using Inheritence, I can reuse the methods and the fields of the parent class.
